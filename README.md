# 🎓 Student Grade Management System (CLI-Based)

A simple command-line Python program to manage students, courses, and grades using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

This project is designed to strengthen your understanding of:
- `@staticmethod`
- `@property` and `@setter`
- Private (`__var`) and Protected (`_var`) attributes
- OOP design patterns (encapsulation, abstraction)

---

## 🚀 Features

- Add, view, and update student details
- Add and assign courses to students
- Input and validate grades
- Calculate GPA (as a read-only property)
- Password-protected access (private attribute)
- Clean CLI menu for interaction

---

## 🧱 Tech & Tools

- Language: Python 3
- Structure: CLI program with modular design
- No external libraries required

---

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

| Concept | How it’s used |
|--------|---------------|
| `@staticmethod` | Grade validation method |
| `@property` / `@setter` | GPA calculation, name/email updates |
| `_protected` | Student/course internal data |
| `__private` | Secure data like password hashes |
| OOP principles | Class design, encapsulation, modularity |
